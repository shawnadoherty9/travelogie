# Security Fix: Tour Operators Contact Information Protection

## Issue Description
**Security Finding:** Business Contact Information Could Be Harvested for Spam
- **Level:** ERROR
- **Table:** `tour_operators`
- **Problem:** The table was publicly readable with sensitive `contact_email` and `contact_phone` fields exposed to anonymous users, allowing malicious actors to scrape contact information for spam or phishing attacks.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Database Security Functions
Created two secure functions to protect sensitive data:

#### `get_public_tour_operators()`
- **Purpose:** Returns safe tour operator data for public viewing
- **Access:** Available to anonymous and authenticated users
- **Security:** Excludes sensitive contact fields (`contact_email`, `contact_phone`)
- **Returns:** All safe fields like business_name, description, ratings, specialties, etc.

#### `get_tour_operator_contact(operator_id)`
- **Purpose:** Returns contact information only for legitimate booking purposes
- **Access:** Requires authentication (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
- **Security:** Only authenticated users can access contact details
- **Returns:** contact_email and contact_phone for specific operator

### 2. Updated RLS Policies
Replaced the overly permissive public read policy with restricted policies:

- **Removed:** `"Allow public read access to active tour operators"`
- **Added:** `"Authenticated users can view basic tour operator info"` - allows authenticated users to see basic info (no contact details)
- **Kept:** `"Authenticated users can manage their own tour operator profile"` - operators can manage their own profiles

### 3. Frontend Integration
Created secure React hook (`useTourOperators.tsx`):

```typescript
// Safe public data access
const { operators, loading, getTourOperatorContact } = useTourOperators();

// Secure contact info access (requires authentication)
const contactInfo = await getTourOperatorContact(operatorId);
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Contact Information Protection:** Email and phone numbers are no longer exposed to anonymous users
2. **Legitimate Access Preserved:** Authenticated users can still access contact info for booking purposes
3. **Spam Prevention:** Eliminates bulk scraping of contact information
4. **Phishing Protection:** Reduces risk of contact details being used for malicious purposes
5. **Backward Compatibility:** Existing functionality remains intact for legitimate users

## Usage Guidelines

### For Public Display (Anonymous Users)
- Use `get_public_tour_operators()` function
- Shows all safe information: ratings, descriptions, specialties, etc.
- Contact information is hidden

### For Booking/Contact (Authenticated Users)
- Use `get_tour_operator_contact(operator_id)` function
- Requires user authentication
- Returns contact details for legitimate booking purposes

## Files Modified
1. **Database Migration:** New security functions and updated RLS policies
2. **src/hooks/useTourOperators.tsx:** New secure React hook
3. **src/pages/Tours.tsx:** Updated to use secure hook
4. **SECURITY_FIX_TOUR_OPERATORS.md:** This documentation

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify anonymous users cannot access contact information
2. Confirm authenticated users can retrieve contact info for booking
3. Test that tour operators can still manage their own profiles
4. Validate public tour operator listings still display properly

This fix maintains all existing functionality while protecting sensitive business contact information from being harvested for spam or malicious purposes.
